"""
The purpose of this script is to download the information for every single historical
NHL player, along with their HockeyReference unique ID (their link).

HockeyReference doesn't provide an easy way to view all players, however,
they have a table of every single NHL player who is born on a certain day.

By iterating through all 366 calendar days and saving the players from each day,
we will eventually download the data for every single NHL player on the HR database.

requests: fetching HTML files from the web
BeautifulSoup: parsing HTML files
pandas: data manipulation with HTML data tables, exporting data as CSV
random: to stagger my web requests to avoid suspicion
time: to have the code "wait" between each request
